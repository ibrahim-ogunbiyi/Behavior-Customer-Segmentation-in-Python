# Business Problem
The marketing team is required to carry out a marketing campaign in the coming year, and we were instructed to create a customer segmentation model in which we separate customers depending on their behavior toward the business. So we build the segmentation using the common marketing metrics which are: 
- Recency
- Frequency
- Monetary Value

# Methodology
- Jupyter environment (Jupyter Lab or Jupyter notebook) – for experimenting our project.
- Pandas – For loading data as a dataframe and wrangling the data.
- Scikit-Learn – For building our Customer Segmentation Model.
- Seaborn, Matplotlib and Plotly Express – for data visualization.
